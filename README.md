# Machine-learning
I am Venkatesh, an 18-year-old B.Tech undergraduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. In this repository, I share machine learning models using regression algorithms along with the source files and datasets. If you are new to ML, I hope this repository helps you to understand ML and enhance your learning experience.

Let me know if you'd like any changes!
